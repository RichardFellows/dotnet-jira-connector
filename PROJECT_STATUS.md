## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS**

### **IMMEDIATE - Feature Branch Commits Required**
**Each agent must create their own feature branch and commit their work:**

1. **Config Expert** → Create & commit to `feature/configuration-management`
2. **API Client Expert** → Create & commit to `feature/jira-api-client`  
3. **DuckDB Specialist** → Create & commit to `feature/database-layer`
4. **Sync Expert** → Create & commit to `feature/data-synchronization`
5. **TDD Test Writer** → Create & commit to `feature/comprehensive-testing`

**Tech Lead Responsibilities:**
- Review each feature branch via PR
- Merge approved branches to `main`
- Maintain integration and console app on `main`

### **TODAY - Testing Phase**
1. **TDD Test Writer** → Complete database service tests
2. **Test Coverage Analyzer** → Validate 90%+ coverage target
3. **Performance Optimizer** → Optimize bulk operations
